Some things to consider:

To add nouns to your world, create models in rails

To show your nouns, you'll need:

A controller action to send the data
A fetch request to ask for the data
Some JavaScript code to handle DOM-rendering
To make your page respond to the user, you'll need event listeners

To keep your code clean, you should use JavaScript classes

To organize your code, you can use multiple JavaScript files (don't forget to add <script> tags for each one!)

Good luck, and happy building!
